# 💻 Coding Problems
This is a repository to store my attempts of solving problems and then analyzing them for improvements

# 🧠 What I've learned from Leetcode challenges
## #️⃣ Arrays & Hashing
### 217. Contains Duplicate Leetcode
- Learned about Python's set object which makes use of a hash table
- Set using Hash Tables uses fixed amount of memory beforehand which is more memory efficient than a list which needs to allocate memory for each new element
- Since we need to continuously check every new element we get to, set makes it easier and more efficient to search through it

## 📍Two Pointers
#### 125. Valid Palindrome
- Learned that use of Regex is actually very inefficient for memory optimizations due to it's backtracking nature
- Only use regex for specific patterns over more broad patterns

## Stack
### 20. Valid Parentheses
- My runtime and memory wasn't great due to creating a class from scratch for the Stack
- We can imitate the behaviour of a Stack with a list to get better runtimes (This can be done with append() which acts as push, and the inbuilt pop())
