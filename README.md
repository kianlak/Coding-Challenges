# Coding Problems
This is a repository to store my attempts of solving problems and then analyzing them for improvements

# What I've learned from Leetcode challenges
## Arrays & Hashing
### 217. Contains Duplicate Leetcode
- Learned about Python's set object which makes use of a hash table
- Set using Hash Tables uses fixed amount of memory beforehand which is more memory efficient than a list which needs to allocate memory for each new element
- Since we need to continuously check every new element we get to, set makes it easier and more efficient to search through it

## Two Pointers
#### 125. Valid Palindrome
- Learned that use of Regex is actually very inefficient for memory optimizations due to it's backtracking nature
- Only use regex for specific patterns over more broad patterns
