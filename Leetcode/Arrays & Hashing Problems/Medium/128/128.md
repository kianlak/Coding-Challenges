# üí° Explanation for [128](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/)
## ‚ùóThis is not the most efficient way to solve this, this is just my solution‚ùó
### Here we transfer over everything from the array into a HashSet (set) so we can make use of the .contains() method for sets to check for the following value.
```java
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
for (int num : nums) set.add(num);
```
### Next we go through a for loop that goes through every individual value in set and check if the set does not contain a number less than itself, we do this so that when we only go through values starting points. Once we do find a starting point value, we then go through a while loop that checks for all values that would come next, and stops when it cannot find a new value, while looping, it increments a value that counts the streak length (currentStreak) and stops once the loop stops. We then compare it to whatever our longest streak value is (longestStreak) and then replace its value if we found a higher streak.
```java
for (int num : set) {
  if (!set.contains(num - 1)) {
    int currentNum = num;
    int currentStreak = 1;

    while (set.contains(currentNum + 1)) {
      currentNum += 1;
      currentStreak += 1;
    }

    longestStreak = Math.max(longestStreak, currentStreak);
  }
}
```
### Once we went through the entire set we then return the longest streak as our answer.
