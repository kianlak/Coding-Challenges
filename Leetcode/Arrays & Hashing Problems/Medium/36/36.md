# ðŸ’¡ Explanation for [36](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/)
### My initial solution had made use of searching rows and columns to make sure that this is a valid sudoku board, however I had not read that I needed to make a box check so I made use of someone elses solution who designed their problem to solve all 3 steps neede.
### This solution makes use of 3 different sets (rows, columns, and squares), in which all store data and then check if there are repeats. 
```python
# 3 Sets being initialized before the save time
rows = [set() for x in range(9)]
columns = [set() for x in range(9)]
squares = [[set() for x in range(3)] for y in range(3)]
```
### If a repeat is found we return false and conclude the program, else we return true if it goes through the entire 2D array (board).
```python
if cell_value in rows[x] or cell_value in columns[y] or cell_value in squares[x//3][y//3]:
  return False

# Add in the new value for the next iterations check
rows[x].add(cell_value)
columns[y].add(cell_value)
squares[x//3][y//3].add(cell_value)
```
