# 💡 Explanation for [49](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/)
## ❗This is not the most efficient way to solve this, this is just my solution❗
### In my solution we iterate through the given list of words (strs) and remove each one we read after we check all the conditions within the while loop, effectively going through and checking each word 1-by-1.
```python
while strs:
  # Other conditions here

  del strs[0]
```
### We have a couple of variables set before the while loop runs.
### Our return list (anagram_groups), our defaultdict that holds the index of the group it belongs in along with the word it looks for (anagram_dictionary), and then the amount of entries in the dictionary (dictionary_entry).
```python
anagram_groups = []
anagram_dictionary = collections.defaultdict(int)
dictionary_entries = 0
```
### When we enter the while loop we check if the given word we're on has its sorted version inside of anagram_dictionary, if it doesn't exist we go ahead and add the sorted version of that word into anagram_groups along with it's index (We doe this so that we add all future versions of that anagram into the same list group as itself). When we do this we increment dictionary_entry as we also add this word into the dictionary. If the word does exist in anagram_dictionary, we go ahead and append it into the anagram_groups by taking the value of the equivalent key (The key being the sorted version of the word) and append it to it's respective list. We do this while going through each word from the list individually until the list is finished.
```python
word = strs[0]
sort = ''.join(sorted(word))

if sort in anagram_dictionary:
  anagram_groups[anagram_dictionary[sort]].append(word)
else:
  anagram_dictionary[sort] = dictionary_entries
  anagram_groups.insert(dictionary_entries, [word])
  dictionary_entries += 1
```
### A much more elegant and runtime efficient solution would be the code below (Not written by me):
```python
class Solution:
  def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
    letters_to_words = defaultdict(list)
    for word in strs:
      letters_to_words[tuple(sorted(word))].append(word)
    return list(letters_to_words.values())
```
