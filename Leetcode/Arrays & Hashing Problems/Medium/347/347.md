# ðŸ’¡ Explanation for [347](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/)
### My solution is quite simple as it makes use of a dictionary (dict) to store each key, the number, with the value, its frequency in the list (nums).
### We go through nums and if an element doesn't exist in the dictionary that's in nums, we set it into dict and give it a value of 1, representing it's first time showing up.
### If the element does exist however we increment it's value respectively in the dictionary. 
```python
for _ in nums:
  if _ in dic:
    dic[_] = dic[_] + 1
  else:
    dic[_] = 1
```
### After that we reverse the dictionary inputs into a list (arr) to have it in ascending order, and then return the last k elements in arr.
```python
arr = sorted(dict, key = dict.get, reverse = True)
return arr[:k]
```
