# ðŸ’¡ Explanation for [217](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
### We loop through each value of nums and check if it exists in the current set, if it does we return True (There is a duplicate),
### otherwise we add the value that we read and add it into the set. If we read through everything in nums and don't return True,
### then we return False (There is no duplicate)
```python
seen = set()

for num in nums:
  if num in seen:
    return True
  seen.add(num)

return False
```
