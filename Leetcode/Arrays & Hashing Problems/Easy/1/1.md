# ðŸ’¡ Explanation for [1](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)
### Here we iterate through a for loop to check if our current index value has a complementing hashmap value to reach the target, if not we add the current complement into the hashmap.
```python
hash = {}

for i, num in enumerate(nums):
  complement = target - num

  if complement in hash:
    return [hash[complement], i]

  hash[num] = i
```
