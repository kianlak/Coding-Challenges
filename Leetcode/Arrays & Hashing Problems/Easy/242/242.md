# ðŸ’¡ Explanation [242](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)
### We use the collections.defaultdict (tracker) to store each unique letter with the number of occurences from the word (s).
```python
tracker = collections.defaultdict(int)

for _ in s: 
  tracker[_] += 1
```
### We then go through the other word (t) to subtract the number of occurences of each letter from trackers occurences of those same letters.
```python
for _ in t: 
  tracker[_] -= 1
```
### At the end we check if every value of tracker is set to 0, indicating that there was an exact amount of each letter from both s and t,
### which should return True if it's an anagram, and False if otherwise.
```python
return all(x == 0 for x in tracker.values())
```
