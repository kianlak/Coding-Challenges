# 💡 Explanation [125](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
## ❗This is not the most efficient way to solve this, this is just my solution❗
### I start by lowercasing everything in the word (s) to make sure that it accounts for possible camelCase, random cases, etc...
### After that I use Regex to check if the characters are alphanumeric or not, if they are they stay, otherwise they are substituted out.
```python
s = s.lower()
s = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', s)
```
### At this point I have formatted s as needed and check the full word vs. the reversed word to see if it is a palindrome
```python
if s == s[::-1]:
  return True
return False
```
