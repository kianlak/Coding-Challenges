# 💡 Explanation for [167](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/url)
## ❗This is not my solution❗
### For this solution we make use of the binary search method since the input array we are going through is sorted.
### Just like in binary search we establish the left and right indices (left and right respectively). Now when we put it through the while loop, we have the addition between both left and right into a variable to check if the we found the target value (target). 
```java
int[] indice = new int[2];
int left = 0, right = num.length - 1;

while (left < right) {
  int v = num[left] + num[right];
  
  if (v == target) {
    indice[0] = left + 1;
    indice[1] = right + 1;
    break;
  }
  // Extra code
}
```
### We also check if v is greater than or less than the target value, and when checking this, we make sure that we move the left and right indices as needed.
```java
while (left < right) {
  int v = num[left] + num[right];
  
  if (v == target) {
    indice[0] = left + 1;
    indice[1] = right + 1;
    break;
  } else if (v > target) {
    right --;
  } else {
    left ++;
  }
}

return indice;
```
