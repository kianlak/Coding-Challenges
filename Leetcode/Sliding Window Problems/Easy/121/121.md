# ðŸ’¡ Explanation for [121](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
### We start off by setting variables to signify the best investment made so far (best_roi) and the smallest buy price so far (buy).
```python
best_roi = 0
buy = sys.maxsize
```
### We now go through the given list (prices) with a for loop and get each individual value (sell). We set a condition in the for loop that checks to see if sell is ever smaller than the buy price, and if it is, the new buy price is set to sell. If this condition isn't true though, we compare the current best_roi with the newly calculated one and then set best_roi to whichever would result in a greater value.
```python
for sell in prices:
  if sell < buy:
    buy = sell
  best_roi = max(best_roi, sell - buy)
```
### Once the for loop is done we then return the results for what the current best_roi is (Which should be the best investment made)
