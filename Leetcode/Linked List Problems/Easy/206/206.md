# ðŸ’¡ Explanation [206](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
### We start off by initializing an empty Linked List (reverse_list) and then starting a while loop that checks to make sure it runs until the original Linked List (head) is None (This means we've finished iterating through the Linked List).
### The first step is to get the next value in the Linked List (head.next) and set it into a temporary variable (temp).
### Temp will later be used to be set into the original Linked List (head) to act as if we've moved forward one step into the Linked List.
```python
temp = head.next
```
### The next step is to set head.next to reverse_list, which sets head to point to the current reversed version of the Linked List.
### We then set reverse_list to head, and what this essentially does is reverse the order of the Linked List one value at a time.
```python
head.next = reverse_list
reverse_list = head
```
### Now to set head back to it's original value except for the part we've inserted into reverse_list, we can set head to temp.
```python
head.next = reverse_list
head = temp
```
