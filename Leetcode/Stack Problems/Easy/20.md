# üí° Explanation [20](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
## ‚ùóThis is not the most efficient way to solve this, this is just my solution‚ùó
### I made my own Stack class to simulate Java type Stacks with some extra functionalities such as is_empty and get_stack which are self explanatory
```python
class Stack:
  def __init__(self):
    self.items = []

  def push(self, item):
    self.items.append(item)

  def pop(self):
    if not self.is_empty():
      return self.items.pop()

  def peek(self):
    if not self.is_empty():
      return self.items[-1]

  def is_empty(self):
    return len(self.items) == 0

  def get_stack(self):
    return self.items
```
### We start off by setting a basic dictionary of matching characters (parenth_match), initializing the new Stack (stack) and creating a variable that checks the last read in value (popped)
```python
parenth_match = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
stack = Stack()
popped = ''
```
### We then go through a for loop that starts from index 0 and goes until it reaches the length of the list (s).
### Inside the for loop we have our first condition that checks to make sure that the current character being read has a value in the dictonary, while the stack is not empty.
### If the condition isn't met we just add the character of the current index into our stack.
### If this value does exist then we pop the current stack and set that value into popped.
### Within this condition still, we have one more condition to check for, and that's if the parenthesis key fits with the popped value, and if it doesn't we return False, otherwise the program continues.
```python
if parenth_match.get(s[_]) and not stack.is_empty():
  popped = stack.pop()
  if popped != parenth_match[s[_]]:
    return False
else:
  stack.push(s[_])
```
### Once we've iterated through the entire list, we have one last check to see whether we return True or False.
### If we have any more elements in stack, that means that there was a parenthesis that was never matched, therefore will return False, otherwise we return True
```python
if stack.is_empty():
  return True
else:
  return False
```
