# ðŸ’¡ Explanation for [226](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
### We make use of recursion to travel through the left and right nodes and set them as the right and left nodes respectively of the root they are being read from.
```python
root.left, root.right = self.invertTree(root.right), self.invertTree(root.left)
```
## Visual Explanation of trees change through each stack iteration 
#### I am aware that there are technically more stack iterations, this is just to simplify and lessen the amount of drawings of the tree
